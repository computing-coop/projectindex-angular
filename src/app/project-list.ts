Its theory was pristine -- documenta 14 featured many works addressing issues ranging from the refugee crisis to transgender rights. But what does it mean for a Western European institution to depict (and generate revenue from) the suffering of marginalized bodies?",
            "Although I am not so naive to think that a branding system can do much to answer this question, I chose to use the branding as a platform to engage in self-reflective institutional critique. I used a stock image of the ocean and a bright red, constantly shifting '15' as my central visual identity. The ocean both ties into issues of climate change and human displacement, as well as the relationship that these two things have. The '15' points to the instability and constant shifting of geographical, political, and social borders, and the risks people take to cross them.",

            "To my parents, the construction of “queerness” is completely foreign, an entirely Western corruption. I too, don’t always identify fully with this idea of what it means to be queer in the West that has emerged within the last 20 years or so. I long to be able to reconcile the category of ‘queer’ with Eastern notions of filial piety. Both seem important to me. I seem to exist between the space that the social construction of ‘fag’ occupies and the space that the ‘fob’ (fresh off the boat) occupies. FAG + FOB = FOG. And ‘fog’ seems like the right word to describe this non-space.",

Liberal?) audience. There’s an epistemic market for these metaphors for overlapping axes of power (intersection, dichotomy, constellation, fog, etc.) and here I am, serving them up, reiterating yet again the incomprehensibility of my otherness.",

By turning attention on whiteness itself, I hope to make whiteness no longer invisible, and to encourage white people to talk about race amongst themselves, without necessarily needing the emotional labor of people of color to explain things to them. I really tried hard to have a generous attitude, but throughout the writing process, I wondered if it came off as patronizing. Is it okay to be patronizing to white people?",

I don’t know… It’s definitely not fair, but I just think that, although it isn’t fair, most of the burdens and labor in the fight towards racial justice will fall on people of color. Because if we don’t take that up, who will do it for us?",
            "White people who truly care (or think they care) need to realize that because they were born under the auspices of the system that was created for them, that also means that they were born with a responsibility to fight for racial justice."
